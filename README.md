# Flow-beginner-course-project-1
This project entails creating my first smart contract using structs

I deployed a new contract named 'Moi' that has a struct, called 'FavMovie' which contains a string of the title of my favorite movie and an int of the number of times i've seen the movie

I then created a dictionary called 'theMovie' which would contain details of my favorite movie

The 'addMyMovie' function was then created to add values to the dictionary

Then I added the 'AddMovie' transaction to call the addMyMovie function in the contract

A script(YourMovie) was then added to read the struct
